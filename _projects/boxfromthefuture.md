# The Box from the Future

The box from the future is a design prompt generator for creating speculative design and design fiction.

Inspired from The Thing From The Future card game and uses the same set of categories and words.

By building it into a physical box it is possible to use it in workshops and redesign it's shape and/or re-tell it's origin so it can act as a more elaborate narrative element in the workshop.

I have added toggle switches which enables both the workshop facilitator, the participants or even just the lone user of the box to customize the categories to fit a theme or another set of constraints.   This means that you can en- or disable elements of the prompts just to your liking. Say that you already have a particular future in mind for your setting you might choose to disable the two arc elements and the mood allowing your participants to fully focus  on your central vision.

The box was built to help facilitate workshops which use design fiction at the digital design education at Aarhus University. It has already been part of several workshops.
