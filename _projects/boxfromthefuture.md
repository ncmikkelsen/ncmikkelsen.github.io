The Box from the Future is a design prompt generator for creating speculative design and design fiction. It was built to help facilitate workshops which use design fiction at the digital design education at Aarhus University and has already been part of several workshops. The Box is inspired by [The Thing From The Future card game](http://situationlab.org/projects/the-thing-from-the-future/) and uses the same sets of categories and words.

By building the prompt generator into a physical box I've enabled it to act as more elaborate narrative element in workshops. Facilitators or users are able to modify it's shape and appearance and make it part of the larger narrative of the workshop.

I have added toggle switches which enables both the workshop facilitator, the participants or even just the lone user of the box to customize the categories to fit a theme or another set of constraints.   This means that you can enable or disable elements of the prompts just to your liking. Say that you already have a particular future in mind for your setting you might choose to disable the two arc elements and the mood allowing your participants to fully focus on your central vision.
