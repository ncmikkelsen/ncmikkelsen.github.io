Open Pollution is a data-visualization project utilizing open data from the Open Data Copenhagen platform (http://data.kk.dk/).

Pollution data is visualized, in real-time, on a map of Copenhagen by switching pixels, generating a glitch-like effect concentrated on the areas were the data shows a higher concentration of pollution.

The project aims to bring attention to the invisible pollution by utilizing the glitch-like effects as both a metaphor for the pollution and a visualization of it.
