Kompost is an interactive digital installation created in collaboration with Hannibal Glaser and Arne Knutinge Kaas for Aarhus Psych Fest, an annual psychedelic and alternative music festival.

Kompost uses a mixture of projection mapping and computer vision to draw festival-participants into an engaging interactive experience.

The call for artworks from the festival specified a theme of darkness and green. From this starting point we decided to work with decomposition as a theme. We sought to create an experience that could contain a combination of the organic decomposition as in death and the loss of physical form, the decomposition of the mental-self tying into the festivals psychedelic nature and its reflection on the self.

We build a wall of sharp shapes onto which the viewer was projected. When a face was recognized it would begin a process of digital decomposition glitching and slowly rendering the face of the viewer unviewable. The wall can both be seen as a organic forest floor rendering the viewer one with nature or as a multitude of digital screens protruding capturing the viewer and destroying her.
