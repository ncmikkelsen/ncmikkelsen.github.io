Jorn was created for The Art Centre Silkeborg Bad, as part of the Jorn Lab marking the 100th birthday of the late Danish painter Asger Jorn.

The art centre wanted an interactive piece that allowed their visitors to explore a work of Asger Jorn.

I created an interactive processing sketch that allowed you to pull apart and rearrange the different elements of the painting. The sketch was displayed on a tablet allowing the visitors themselves to rearrange the elements of the painting and gain a greater appreciation for it.

The project was exhibited from April 26. to September 7. 2014.
