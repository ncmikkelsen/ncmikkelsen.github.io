# Just Like That

I wanted to investigate the relationship between our acting on social networks and the pleasure we obtain from this.

To do this I built Just Like That: a pair of underwear that vibrate whenever you receive notifications on Facebook. The underwear is fully functional serving as a provocation by enabling you to obtain this physical pleasure from your online interactions by simply putting them on, hidden from everyone else. Is this what you want? Now you can have it, just like that.

Just like that was built in collaboration with Mark Moore.
